# For MacBook users, highly recommend having its own environment with conda

#To check if you're in the correct conda environment:
conda env list
#The active environment will have an asterisk (*) next to it. You want to be in the rna-seq environment.
#If you're not in it, activate it first:
conda activate rna-seq
